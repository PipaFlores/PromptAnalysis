I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!,FASHION
This is a great layering tank that is super comfy! the sale price is a bargain!,FASHION
"Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on, but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me",FASHION
"I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.

overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site",FASHION
"Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.",FASHION
These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.,FASHION
"I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow",FASHION
"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",FASHION
I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick,FASHION
"I was surprised how great this blouse looks on! the color and texture are awesome.... very well made, but runs a tad small. this will be my new go to when i open my closet!",FASHION
"Love this top, super soft and drapes great, even after washing. it is pretty long and loose, but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers!",FASHION
"Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses, thermals, henleys, blazers, etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly.",FASHION
These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.,FASHION
Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.,FASHION
"This shirt spoke to me, as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid, the flattering cut, and the light, airy material. at very least, i think this will be a three-season go to!",FASHION
"This is the softest, most perfectly cut basic. love the black, wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics, i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.",FASHION
"This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!",FASHION
"The shirt is amazing in the photo..but when it arrived in the package to my house, it is sooooo dark that you can't see the patchwork. not happy. going to return it. it was a holiday gift.",FASHION
"Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color.",FASHION
"I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium, size 6 around 5' 8, and i chose the m/l, which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric, which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care, i am exchanging for another one in small.",FASHION
